# Stack

## Introduction

This is my own version of typical data structure - stack. You can use canary or hash protection in file config.h. There is a dump in logfiles directory. 

## How to use

Everything you need to test my stack, is just copying For usage in your terminal/console.

For usage:

```
git clone https://github.com/kefirRzevo/Stack.git
cd Stack
make
```
